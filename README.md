In this section, prices of precious metals like Gold, Silver, Platinum, and Palladium were predicted using neural networks. Advanced neural network models which include stacked layers of Recurrent Neural Networks of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit are used to predict and forecast the prices, which can capture the trend of the price movements and provide predictions with low errors. 
Based on the forecasted prices, excel solver was used to create a portfolio of metals which maximizes the profit with the least risk.
